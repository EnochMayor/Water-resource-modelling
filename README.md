# Municipal Groundwater Supply Resilience (Groundwater Modelling)

## Overview
This project reassesses a municipal groundwater supply system and builds a modelling-supported framework for **long-term reliability**, accounting for demand growth and infrastructure stressors.

## Objective
Reassess groundwater availability and develop a resilient supply framework that supports sustainable service delivery under projected population growth.

## Approach
- Built a conceptual hydrogeologic understanding of the system
- Developed a **MODFLOW-based workflow** to simulate groundwater flow and hydraulic gradients
- Evaluated groundwater–surface water interactions and operational sensitivity
- Tested scenarios to understand supply resilience under increasing demand
- Structured outputs for defensible reporting and decision support (QA/QC-driven)

## Deliverables
- Model domain + boundary condition setup documentation
- Head distribution and gradient interpretation
- Scenario results supporting reliability and sustainability decisions
- Clear recommendations aligned with operational constraints

## Tools
MODFLOW • GIS (ArcGIS/QGIS) • ParaView/PyVista for visualization • Python for analysis and plotting
